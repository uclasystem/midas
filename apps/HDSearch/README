# HDSearch with Midas

## Compile

```bash
# Here we assume that Midas runtime has been compiled.
# Or else please compile Midas runtime first.
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Usage

We first need to prepare the dataset: `./prepare_dataset.sh`.
The script will create a `data/` directory and prepare the ImageNet dataset.

Then we can launch Midas coordinator (if it has not been launched yet):

```bash
cd $MIDAS_REPO_ROOT_PATH # replace it with the path to the repo root directory.
./scripts/run_daemon.sh
```

And finally launch HDSearch:

```bash
# In the current directory
./run.sh
```
